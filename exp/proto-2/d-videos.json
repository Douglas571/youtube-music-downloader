I'm almost 25\nCan't remember half the time that I've been alive\n'Cause half was in a cheap apartment\nAnd half was on the Eastside (Eastside)\nThey said don't meet your heroes, they're all fuckin' weirdos\nAnd God knows that they were right\nBecause nobody loves you, they just try to fuck you\nThen put you on a feature on the B-Side\nAnd who do you call when it's late at night?\nWhen the headlines just don't paint the picture right\nWhen you look at yourself on a screen and say\n\"Oh my God, there's no way that's me\"\nAnd I, I quit smoking, well recently, I tried\nAnd I bought another house, and I never go outside\nAnd I remember this girl with pink hair in Detroit\nWell, she told me\nShe said, \"Ashley, you gotta promise us that you won't die\n'Cause we need you,\" and honestly, I think that she lied\nAnd I remember the names of every single kid I've met\nBut I forget half the people who I've gotten in bed\nAnd I've stared at the sky in Milwaukee\nAnd hoped that my father would finally call me\nAnd it's just these things that I'm thinkin' for hours\nAnd I'm pickin' my hair out in clumps in the shower\nLost the love of my life to an ivory powder\nBut then I realized that I'm no higher power\nThat I wasn't in love then, and I'm still not now\nAnd I'm so happy I figured that out\nI've got a long way to go until self-preservation\nThink my moral compass is on a vacation\nAnd I can't believe I still feed my fucking temptation\nI'm still looking for my salvation\n\n[Chorus]\nSoft and slow, watch the minutes go\nCount out loud, so we know you don't keep 'em for yourself\nWatch the minutes go\nCount out loud, so we know you don't keep 'em for yourself\n\n[Interlude]\nI think I have a confession to make (So we know you don't)\nTo prove to say that I was really born at 9:26\nI saw my birth certificate, and I'm a liar\nAnd I'm a fucking liar\n\n[Outro]\nSoft and slow, watch the minutes go\nCount out loud, so we know you don't keep 'em for yourself\n\n.........\n👨‍💻 If you like \"Halsey - 929\" check out these other tracks: \n\n- Silk City, Dua Lipa - Electricity (Lyrics) ft.
